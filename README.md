# 🌦️ Real-Time FPGA-Based Weather Classification System  
### Using Offline-Trained Decision Tree Logic

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

This project presents a **real-time weather classification system** implemented entirely on an **FPGA (Basys3)** using custom **Verilog logic**, without any processor, Wi-Fi, or cloud dependency.  

The system classifies environmental conditions such as **Clear**, **Partly Cloudy**, **Mostly Cloudy**, **Overcast**, and **Foggy** based on real-time **temperature** and **humidity** readings from a **DHT11 sensor**.  

The classification logic is derived from an **offline-trained Decision Tree model** developed in **Python** and translated into **hardware logic** for FPGA deployment. The classified results are displayed both on an **LCD module** and via **UART** on a **PC terminal (PuTTY)**.

## 💡 Motivation  

Modern embedded systems often rely on processors or cloud-based inference for decision-making.  
This project demonstrates how **machine learning intelligence can be embedded directly into FPGA hardware**, eliminating the need for processors or internet connectivity.  

By integrating trained model thresholds directly into Verilog, the design achieves:  

- ⚡ **Ultra-low latency** real-time classification  
- 🌐 **Fully offline**, deterministic operation  
- 🔋 **Energy-efficient**, hardware-level intelligence  

This approach bridges the gap between **AI and digital design**, proving that ML models can be **implemented purely in hardware** for real-world, edge-level applications.

## ⚙️ Methodology  

The entire workflow is shown below (📸 *Image 1 — Methodology Diagram*) and follows six systematic steps:  

### **Step 1 — Dataset Collection**  
Weather data containing **temperature** and **humidity** readings is collected and prepared for training.  

### **Step 2 — Training the Decision Tree Model**  
Using **Python** and **scikit-learn**, a **Decision Tree classifier** is trained to categorize weather conditions such as *Clear, Overcast, Partly Cloudy,* etc.  

### **Step 3 — Extracting Thresholds for Hardware Deployment**  
The **decision boundaries** (thresholds) generated by the trained model are extracted for hardware implementation.

### **Step 4 — Verilog Module Implementation**  
The extracted thresholds are **manually encoded** as `if-else` conditions in Verilog, forming the **weather classification logic**.  

### **Step 5 — Simulation and Verification**  
All Verilog modules are **simulated in Vivado** to verify accurate classification across various temperature and humidity inputs.  

### **Step 6 — Real-Time FPGA Deployment**  
The verified design is implemented on the **Basys3 FPGA**, interfaced with a **DHT11 sensor**, **LCD display**, and **UART** for real-time data visualization.

## 🧩 RTL Schematic  

The **RTL schematic** (📸 *Image 2*) illustrates the internal module hierarchy and signal flow.  

**Main Verilog Modules:**  

- **`dht11_interface`** — Reads the 40-bit data frame from the DHT11 sensor and extracts temperature & humidity.  
- **`weather_classifier`** — Implements the threshold-based classification logic derived from the trained model.  
- **`lcd_display`** — Displays temperature, humidity, and weather condition on the LCD module.  
- **`uart_display`** — Transmits the same data to a PC terminal through UART for live monitoring.  

This modular structure ensures **clean data flow**, **easy debugging**, and **hardware-only classification** with no processor intervention.
